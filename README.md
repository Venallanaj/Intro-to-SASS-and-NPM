<h2>What is SASS?</h2>
SASS stands for <i>Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet</i>. It is a CSS pre-processore scripting language
that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheetes (CSS)

<h2>Way Use SASS?</h2>

Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex and harder to maintain. This is where pre-preocessore can help

Sass lets you use fetures that do not exist in CSS like:

 <ul>
        <li>variables</li>
        <li>import</li>
        <li>mix</li>
        <li>nesting rules</li>
        <li>inheritance</li>
        <li> build function and another stuff</li>
    </ul>
    this making the coding process easy to do, keeping your code organized and reducing repetition.

<h2>How Does SASS Work?</h2>

A browser does not understend Sass code. Therefore, you will need a Sass preprocessore to converter Sass code into Standart CSS.
This process is calles transpiling. So, you need to give a transpiler (some kind of the program) some
Sass code and then get same Css code back.
