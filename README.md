# Intro-to-SASS-and-NPM

<h1>What is SASS?</h1>
SASS stands for Syntactically Awesome Stylesheet. It is a CSS pre-processore scripting language
that is interpreted or compiled into Cascading Style Sheetes (CSS)

<h2>Way Use SASS?</h2>

Stylesheets are getting larger, more complex and harder to maintain. This is where pre-preocessore can help

Sass lets you use fetures that do not exist in CSS like variables, import, mix, nesting rules, inheritance, build function and another stuff, this making the coding process easy to do, keeping
your code organized and reducing repetition.

How Does SASS Work?

A browser does not understend Sass code. Therefore, you will need a Sass preprocessore to converter Sass code into Standart CSS.

This process is calles transpiling. So, you need to give a transpiler (some kind of the program) some
Sass code and then get same Css code back.
